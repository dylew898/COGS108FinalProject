    "ELO statistics is a system designed to calculate the relative skill levels of players or teams in competition, and used as a predictor for an outcome of a match. These ratings are constantly changing as more games are played and calculate a team's winning percentage based on their winning record. We wanted to study if ELO ratings for an NBA team during one season can help predict their win percentage in following seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to practicallypredictable, they analyze different factors that affect an ELO stat, such as ratings over time, strength of schedule, and team matchups. As a season progresses, rosters may adjust due to a player becoming injured, which could affect a team's ELO statistic depending on the impact that injured player had on the team's winning percentage. They incorporated strenghth of schedule in ELO stats to demonstrate that teams with wins in more difficult schedules throughout the season are more likely to have higher ELO's than teams with weaker schedules. Finally, team matchups can also affect the ELO ratings due to an upset, which means a less favored team beating a stronger team based on stats. This unpredictable outcome heavily sways a team's rating to a higher number, which could lead to higher chances of winning more games.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously, it’s clear that higher ELO is correlated with getting more wins. Yet, depending on whether it is the regular season or playoffs, this condition may overestimate or underestimate a team’s probability of winning. For example, in the regular season, stronger teams such as the 2018 Golden State Warriors would “coast,” or play with less effort, and lose meaningless games they should have won. Going by Elo rating, 538 gives Golden State just a 14% chance of winning another championship in 2019. This model under-rates Golden State’s ability to win games that matter, as the team is known to pick up the pace in April and dominate the playoffs. "
